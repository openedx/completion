A library for tracking completion of blocks by learners in edX courses.

Overview
________

This repository provides a Django model `BlockCompletion` that is intended to be plugged into ``edx-platform``.  It
provides various handlers and services for the recording of completion data.  It also provides a DRF API for submitting
completion data in batches.

Enabling in the LMS
-------------------
By default, the Open edX LMS does not use this library. To turn it on, go to http://localhost:18000/admin/waffle/switch/ (substitute your LMS URL for http://localhost:18000/), and add a new switch with Name ``completion.enable_completion_tracking`` and Active selected.

See `Completion Tool <https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/open-edx-building-and-running-a-course/en/latest/exercises_tools/completion.html>`_ in the Open edX documentation for details on what will happen once enabled.

How To Contribute
-----------------

Contributions are very welcome.

Please read `How To Contribute <https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ for details.

Even though they were written with ``edx-platform`` in mind, the guidelines
should be followed for Open edX code in general.

PR description template should be automatically applied if you are sending PR from github interface; otherwise you
can find it it at `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md <https://github.com/edx/completion/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md>`_

Issue report template should be automatically applied if you are sending it from github UI as well; otherwise you
can find it at `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md <https://github.com/edx/completion/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md>`_

Reporting Security Issues
-------------------------

Please do not report security issues in public. Please email security@edx.org.

Using with Docker Devstack
--------------------------

Prerequisite: Have your Open edX `Devstack <https://github.com/edx/devstack>`_ properly installed.

Note: When you see "from inside the lms" below, it means that you've run ``make lms-shell`` from your devstack
directory and are on a command prompt inside the LMS container.

#. Clone this repo into ``../src/`` directory (relative to your "devstack" repo location). This will mount the
   directory in a way that is accessible to the lms container.

#. From inside the lms, uninstall completion and reinstall your local copy. You can just copy the following line::

    pip uninstall completion -y; pip install -e /edx/src/completion/

#. Now, get your completion development environment set up::

    cd /edx/src/completion
    virtualenv completion-env
    source completion-env/bin/activate
    make install

#. Don't forget to enable the waffle switch as described above in "Enabling in the LMS"

#. That's it!  In order to simulate a given tox environment ``(django18, django111, quality)``, run ``tox -e <env>`` for the env in question.  If you want to run ``pytest`` directly::

    pytest completion/tests/test_models.py
