Purpose
*******

A library for tracking completion of blocks by learners in Open edX courses.

This repository provides a Django model `BlockCompletion` that is intended to be plugged into ``edx-platform``.  It
provides various handlers and services for the recording of completion data.  It also provides a DRF API for submitting
completion data in batches.

Enabling in the LMS
*******************

By default, the Open edX LMS does not use this library. To turn it on, go to http://your.lms.site/admin/waffle/switch/, and add a new switch with Name ``completion.enable_completion_tracking`` and Active selected.

See `Completion Tool <https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/open-edx-building-and-running-a-course/en/latest/exercises_tools/completion.html>`_ in the Open edX documentation for details on what will happen once enabled.

Getting Started with Development
********************************

Please see the Open edX documentation for `guidance on Python development <https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/developers/how-tos/get-ready-for-python-dev.html>`_ in this repo.

To install the ``completion`` app, run these commands from the `completion` root directory:

.. code:: bash

    pip install -e


To run the test suite:

.. code:: bash

    pip install tox
    tox # to run only a single environment, do e.g. tox -e py38-django42-drflatest


To use a Django shell to test commands:

.. code:: bash

    make install
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py shell
    >>> from completion.models import BlockCompletion
    >>> <other commands...>
